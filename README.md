The app will be a simple employee database and we'll learn:

- How to set up Vue
- The anatomy of a Vue file
- How to work with data, methods, conditional statements, and events in Vue
- How to create, update, view, and delete users (employees) from the system
- How to make API calls for each of the above actions
- How to use tables, forms, and form validation
- How to host a Vue build on GitHub pages
